## Introduction

### Dataset Description üìú

The dataset we shall be using in this project is the [European Soccer Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hugomathien/soccer) ‚öΩ. It contains data from soccer matches, players, and teams from several European countries which runs from 2008/2009 to 2015/2016 season. Originally it is available as an sql database but I managed to get the tables as ".csv" from [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/).
The tables provided include:

|Table	  |Total Rows|Total Columns|
|:--------|----------|------------:|

|Player	|11060|7|
|Player_Attributes|183978|42|
|Team	|299	|5|
|Team_Attributes|	1458|	25|

These tables combined provide information on:
- +25,000 matches

- 11 European Countries with their lead championship
